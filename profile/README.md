# Welcome to Naptha

Naptha is a framework and infrastructure for developing and running multi-agent systems at scale with heterogeneous models, architectures and data. Agents and other modules can run on separate devices, while still interacting over the network. Our mission is to reimagine the internet - to bring forth the Web of Agents - by enabling the next-generation of AI applications and use cases.
